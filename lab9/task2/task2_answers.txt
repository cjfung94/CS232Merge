#1: What function does the line i = (addr >> 2) & 7; serve in the simulation?
It simulates ignoring the 2 bit ofset, then comparing the 3 bit index with 7 to see what the index ID is.

#2: Compile and execute the direct-mapped cache simulator given in the task. Report the final number of hits and accesses output by the code. Also, based on the pattern of cache hits, estimate the hit rate of the given trace in the steady state (once the compulsory misses are accounted for).
Hits : 68
Accesses : 103
Hit Rato : 0.660194

Compulsory State:
Hits : 76
Accessess : 103
Hit Ratio: 0.737864
#3: Our implementation of a simple, direct-mapped cache simulator only uses and maintains the tags in its simulation. Why is this enough to get a working example of cache behavior?
This is because it simulates actual cache behavior as far as the theory and concept of it. Where it would load up the cache, and utilize it as per necessary while replacing the information in it
to satisfy the needs of the program.
